In 2 weeks, Team Spartans have created a Facebook clone, imaginatively named Acebook. We had a fluffy pig toy mascot, which provided us with emotional support, and there might be some references to that in this readme.

Real Instructions for Contributions:
  - You are welcome to submit a pull request with any features you'd like to impliment.
  - Please strive for a high test coverage.
  - If overwhelmed, hold the fluffy pig. Do not open. It is a waste of time and it doesn't like it.

Challenges:
  - Heroku worked fine, but 'Ed' if that is his real name, wanted us to stick it on Amazon's web server. Ultimately we managed to do it, but couldn't find a way to continuously deploy within the time frame. There was a bug that even the tutors had trouble finding. 
  
How to Deploy:
  - Acebook The Spartans master branch is automatically deployed on Heroku, providing all RSpec tests pass Travis CI's rigorous testing procedure.
